## Goboss

- Goboss will build your java project, copy to jboss and run-it.
Tested with Jboss EAP 6.4/Wildfly10 on Ubuntu 16.04

## How To

Modify config.json putting your locales and artifacts
- Start button : start jboss/wildfly
- Deploy button : generate artifact > copy do deployment folder
- Clean button : delete all content of deployment folder

## TODO

- Extract maven build command (actually hardcoded)
- Extract jboss start command (actually hardcoded)
- Simplify configs
