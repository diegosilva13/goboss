## Goboss

Build your java project, copy to jboss and run-it.
Tested with Jboss EAP 6.4 on Ubuntu 16.04 (also jboss start is fixed with sh :sweat_smile:)

## How To

- Modify config.json putting your locales and artifacts
- ???
- Profit

## TODO

- Extract maven build command (actually hardcoded)
- Extract jboss start commadn (actually hardcoded)
- Simplify configs
